        1   How many  times is the expression  (a + c) computed  in the original
            code (as seen in the SSA pass)? What about after the FRE pass?
	Ans.  	  If we took glance at our GIMPLE file created, it showing us two
	    computations get calculated.Instead of this in FRE pass each line of 
	    execution get stored by defaut, so that when result of previous computaion
  	    needed, if get it directly rather doing computation again as like case 
     	    mentioned above. 

        2   Have  there been  any more  optimizations  after FRE?  How will  you
            check?

	Ans.  	  After execution of source code get complied, various types of
 	    files get generated automatically. Simillarly, B-4.c.*.optimized also
            get generated. if it having same output as our GIMPLE file, then our 
	    code is already optimized. No, further optimization can possible.

        3   Why did  we have  to put a  "return b" in  this assignment?  What if
            "return b" is changed to "return 0"? Will it make any difference?

	Ans.        We return "b" this time, because we process on variable b.
	    Instead, if we return "0" directly, compiler simply return "0",So there is
            no meaning of making computation and storing result in variable "b".So, 
	    rather computing value for variable "b", Compiler simply get end of the code.
 	    That is the main reason we return integer variable "b".
