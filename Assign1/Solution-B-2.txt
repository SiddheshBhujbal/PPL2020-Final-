        1   What will happen if "a = a + N" is replaced by "a = a + 1"?

	Ans.  	 Here, Again th PHI node merging concept reappears. PHI node 
	    responsible for merging of variable assignment with different paths.
	    If we done the changes and rerun the GIMPLE code..we will get following 
	    important statement as:
             # i_1 = PHI <i_4(2), i_6(3)>                                               
 	     # a_2 = PHI <a_3(2), a_5(3)>  
	    Due to this, value of variables "i" and "a" changes after each iteration.
	    As, Loop executes 4 times four get added to initial value of varianle "a".
	    (As, One is added to "a" after each iteration.)Finally, we get value of "a"
	    as 10.
