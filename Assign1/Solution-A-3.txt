        1   Identify the basic blocks that correspond  to the while loop. How is
            the GIMPLE for a while loop different from simple if-else jumps?
	
	Ans.	   The syntax of a while loop in C programming language is - 
	    while(condition) { statement(s); } Here, statement(s) may be a single 
	    statement or a block of statements. The condition may be any expression, 
	    and true is any nonzero value. The loop iterates while the condition is true.
	    So, if we observed carefully, the while loop itself executed as if-else 
	    conditional statements such as in above if sun<100(sum<=99) then sum=sum*2  
	    (Again this is done by using local variable) and control pass backword
	    (if-statement)else control pass to further block of code."goto" keyword 
	    in GIMPLE uses to pass the control 

        2   Identify the  basic blocks  for the nested  for-loop. You  should be
            able  to identify  intializers, conditions  and increments  for each
            loop as  well as  the shared  inner body.  Is there  really anything
            special about a for-loop as compared to a while-loop?

	Ans. 	  For loop statement allows you to update any loop control variables.
	    If it is true, the loop executes and the process repeats itself (body 
            of loop, then increment step, and then again condition). After the condition
            becomes false, the 'for' loop terminates. A for loop is same as while-loop 
            as it also consist of if-else conditional blocks but differ in method of 
            sepration of initializer declaration. In For loop, initializer are seprated 
            at initial blocks only and increment part takes place at the end of single 
            loop iteration and control again get passed to conditional statement to check 
            certain condition.
