        1   The body  of AddTwo(x)  seems to  be inlined into  the call  of main
            rendering the function useless (nobody else is calling it). Then why
            is the definition of AddTwo(x) still there all the way till the last
            pass (B-1.c.*.optimized)?

	Ans.  	  A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name 
	    and how to call the function. Function declaration is required when you
            define a function in one source file and you call that function in another 
	    file. Same might happen in this case, As function defination is exists
	    the Function name AddTwo(X) might call from another file.In such case, we
	    should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.

        2   Is there any way to get rid of it?
	
	Ans.  	 Functions have scope as well, though their scope is generally larger 
	    than that of most variables.Functions can have global, namespace, class or 
	    local (within another function) scope.In the C programming language, static 
	    is used with global variables and functions to set their scope to the containing 
	    file. In local variables, static is used to store the variable in the statically
	    allocated memory instead of the automatically allocated memory.So, when function 
	    was declared with the "static" keyword it will available to Files.
