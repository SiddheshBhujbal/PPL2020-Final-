        1   How is array declaration and initialization handled?
	
	Ans.	  An array is a collection of data items, all of the same type, accessed
	    using a common name. A one-dimensional array is like a list; A two dimensional
            array is like a table; The C language places no limits on the number of 
            dimensions in an array, though specific implementations may. During array 
            declaration, body of code get splitted into various block of code. Array 
            declaration resembles with the scalar initialization. This array declaration 
            done according to one operation per statement as we seen it through GIMPLE. .

        2   Why does the statement a[i] = b[i] get broken down to two steps with
            an intermediate temporary?

	Ans. 	  "One Operation per Statement", this is the GIMPLE's policy.As, a[i]=b[i]
	    includes reading of data of b[i] and then storing the same value at the position 
	    of a[i] involves two operation.This break the Golden Rule of GIMPLE,So a[i]=b[i]
	    broken down in two step.This assignment done by temporary variable having local
	    scope.

        3   Why are there CLOBBER statements at the end?
	
	Ans. 	  "CLOBBER" tells the compiler that the assembly code might modify any memory,
	    not just variables that are included in the output constraints. CLOBBER is the 
	    keyword in GIMPLE used as adresse-escape variable.This notify the compiler thet 
	    address-escpaed scope of the variable declared earlier is ended completely.
