Que.       The following  is a CFG  dump of a somewhat  meaningful little program.  Can you
        predict the output of  the program just  by looking at  the GIMPLE  dump? Well,
        maybe or  maybe not. But your  task is to  find the corresponding C  program for
         which gcc-4.7.2 generated this GIMPLE dump.
      
Answer:


-----------------------------------------
A-6 Sorce Code in "C" for above GIMPLE
-----------------------------------------
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int i, j;
    for(i = 2; i <= 100; i++) {
        for(j = 2; j < i; j++) {
            if(i % j == 0)
                break;
        }
        if(i == j) {
            printf("%d \n", i);
        }
    }
    return 0;            
}
----------------------------------------------
Explanation:- As code involves 2 if-else conditional statements,
	it is pretty sure that our sorce code involve of two for loop..
	(One in nested)
-----------------------------------------------
Output- After Execution of above source code we will get list of prime
	numbers upto 100 as limit of "i" allowed to be 100.
